# Modifications / Corrections

- ECG in mV: The ECG signals are presented in millivolts (mV).
- ECG 3 leads (2 different plots): The script displays ECG data for three leads. The first plot shows all three leads on the same graph, while the second plot focuses on Lead II before and after filtering.
- Low-pass filtering with plot: The second plot compares the original and filtered Lead II ECG signals. The top graph shows Lead II without filtering, and the bottom graph shows Lead II with a low-pass filter applied.


# Data
