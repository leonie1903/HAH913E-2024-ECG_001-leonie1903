# This exercise is part of the HAH913E course unit, aimed at enhancing our skills in using GitHub for version control and collaborative projects. The objectives of this exercise include:

- Understanding Version Control: Learning how to track changes in our code and collaborate effectively with others.
- Utilizing GitHub Features: Familiarizing ourselves with the various features of GitHub, such as repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.
- Enhancing Collaboration Skills: Developing teamwork skills by working on a shared codebase and managing contributions from multiple team members.
- Practical Application: Applying theoretical knowledge in a real-world context by managing a project from start to finish using GitHub.





# A minimal template for data analysis with python 

This is a minimal template for data analysis with python, intended to researchers in human movement sciences that are new to python.   
Cloning this template for each new data analysis problem should facilitate data analyses with python and minimize potential errors.   

## Usage (without Git)
1. Download as a zip file (green button `< > Code` on the top right of the page)
1. Expand the archive on your computer (e.g., in your `Download` folder). 
1. Rename the extracted folder with the name of your new project (e.g., `ECG_analysis`)
1. Move the new `ECG_analysis` folder where it should be located (e.g., in your `Documents/CodeProjects/` directory)
1. In VSCode :
    1. open the new project in a new window. 
    1. open `main.ipynb` and click `Run all`

## Requirements
- VSCode with the python and jupyter extensions installed (or any other IDE that supports python and jupyter notebooks)
